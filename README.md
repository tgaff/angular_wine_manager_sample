# This app is a simple "wine manager".  It serves as an angular demo app for students.

It uses the following angular components:
* ngRoute
* ngResource
* ngAnimate


# How to run

Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`

# Points to note:

* This app uses the more updated syntax advocated in current style guides.  It avoids the use of `$scope` and instead uses "controller as".
* I received the original code for this from https://github.com/arun-instructor
